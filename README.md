# Flood Prediction System for Cornwall, UK

Welcome to the **Flood Prediction System for Cornwall, UK** – an ambitious, real-time flood prediction project aimed at providing actionable flood risk insights for a region prone to flooding. This system is designed to ingest river gauge and weather data, process and clean it, model flood risks, and ultimately deploy an interactive flood prediction service.

---

## Project Overview 🌊

Cornwall, UK, is a region known for its flood risk, which inspired this project to predict river flood events in real-time. By leveraging various open-source datasets, APIs, and machine learning, this system seeks to deliver accurate and timely flood predictions for communities across the region.

## Objectives 🏆

1. **Real-time Flood Prediction**: Develop a model that predicts river flooding with reliable accuracy for 30 river stations across Cornwall.
2. **Scalable Deployment**: Deploy the model on AWS, enabling users to interact with it in real-time and visualize live predictions.
3. **Comprehensive Workflow**: Build an end-to-end solution from data ingestion to model deployment, demonstrating a full data science pipeline.
4. **Community Engagement**: Share insights, challenges, and progress through weekly video updates on LinkedIn, fostering feedback and connecting with industry professionals.

## Features Implemented 🔧

### Data Collection

- **River Gauge Levels**: 
  - Pulled 10 years of river gauge levels across 30 stations in Cornwall from Shoothill Gauge Map API.
  - Data transformed from JSON to clean, structured CSV files with consistent time-stamps.
- **Weather Data**:
  - Aggregated historical weather observations from NOAA for Cornwall’s available station.
  - Explored several open-source APIs to find reliable, consistent weather data sources.

### Data Cleaning & Transformation

- Extensive data cleaning, including handling missing data, time-stamping inconsistencies, and data normalization.
- All river gauge and weather data are consolidated into CSV files for ease of analysis and reproducibility.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- **Data Visualizations**:
  - Interactive visualizations to understand seasonal and daily river level patterns.
  - Analysis of weather and river gauge correlations to inform feature engineering.
- **Time-Series EDA**:
  - Investigating river level trends to identify potential flood indicators.
  - Analyzing missing data patterns and examining impact on model accuracy.

## Roadmap 🚀

1. **Modeling**: Building baseline regression and classification models, with plans to incorporate time-series modeling for river level prediction.
2. **Threshold-Based Classification**: Convert continuous river level predictions into flood/no-flood classifications.
3. **Deployment**: Deploy a working model on AWS using Docker and serverless architecture to provide a real-time prediction service.
4. **Real-Time Data Pipeline**: Establish an automated pipeline to continuously ingest new data for model re-training and prediction.
