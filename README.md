- document everything
- even document the planning process. This will make you stand out among amateur data scientists
- Skills: deep learning (Pytorch), Data collection through multiple APIs, scraping, data cleaning, Pandas, psychopg, cloud computing to train the model?, Docker/K3s to productionise the model
