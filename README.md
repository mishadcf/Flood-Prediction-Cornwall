## Project Overview

Cornwall's unique geography and climate make it susceptible to flooding. This project leverages data-driven approaches to predict flood events, offering valuable insights for local authorities, residents, and stakeholders to mitigate adverse effects.

## Features

- **Data Collection & Cleaning:** Aggregates historical weather, river levels, and flood incident data.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizes key patterns and trends related to flooding in Cornwall.
- **Machine Learning Models:** Implements and compares multiple algorithms for flood prediction, including:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Random Forest
  - Gradient Boosting Machines
  - Support Vector Machines
  - Neural Networks
- **Model Evaluation:** Assesses model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.

## Data Sources

The project utilizes data from the following sources:

- **Environment Agency:** Historical flood records and river level data.
- **Met Office:** Weather data including rainfall, temperature, wind speed, and more.
- **Ordnance Survey:** Geographical and topographical data of Cornwall.
- **Local Authorities:** Data on flood defenses and infrastructure.

*Ensure compliance with data usage licenses and privacy regulations when accessing and using these datasets.*

## Methodology

1. **Data Collection:** Gathered relevant datasets covering weather patterns, river levels, and historical flood incidents in Cornwall.
2. **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaned and merged datasets, handled missing values, and engineered relevant features.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Conducted statistical analysis and visualizations to understand data distributions and correlations.
4. **Feature Selection:** Identified the most impactful features for flood prediction using techniques like feature importance and correlation matrices.
5. **Model Development:** Trained various machine learning models to predict flood events based on selected features.
6. **Model Evaluation:** Compared models using performance metrics and selected the best-performing model for deployment.


## Next Steps ðŸŽ¯

As the project evolves, Iâ€™ll be refining the model, optimizing feature engineering, and preparing for deployment. The goal is to create a robust, real-time flood prediction tool that effectively demonstrates data engineering, machine learning, and model deployment in a professional context.
